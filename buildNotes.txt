build commands (notes):

Attempt 1
	pyi-makespec --onefile -i icon.png --add-data "design.glade:." main.py
	pyinstaller main.spec

That worked! But the executable takes long to start, and has big size

Attempt 2
	pyi-makespec --onedir -i icon.png --add-data "design.glade:." main.py
	pyinstaller main.spec

Also worked! Executable starts much faster, but size is even bigger

Attempt 3
	pyi-makespec --onedir -i icon.png --add-data "design.glade:." main.py
	Modify the spec file's hooksconfig
		WARNING: don't lose the spec file
	pyinstaller main.spec

Alhamdulillah! Executable is fast, and much smaller than previous attempt
